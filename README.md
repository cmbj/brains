# Brains

This is an exercise creating a responsive table in React following these steps:

- Populate a table using given endpoints.
- When the data is loading into the table, show a loading spinner made entirely of CSS code.
- Put in a deliberate delay of 3 seconds on the table loading (so we can see the loading spinner)
- Put in a deliberate delay of 3 seconds on loading the details of the first row only (so we can see the loading spinner)
- The table must indicate that it is possible to expand the “Children” column cell. Doing this should expand a new table inside the existing table with the new data.
- When the screen width gets below 900 px, hide the "Profession" column.
